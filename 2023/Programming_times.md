# Times to program/solve

Roughly :-) Not counting time to think, as I usually read the problem statement before I have time to solve it.

| Day  	 |              Time  	 | Note 	                                                                                                        |

|   1  	 |              1:00  	 | 	                                                                                                             |
|   2  	 |              0:50  	 | 	                                                                                                             |
|   3  	 |              1:32  	 | Stupid edge cases :-) 	                                                                                       |
|   4  	 |              0:20  	 | Easy peasy today	                                                                                             |
|   5  	 |              2:10  	 | 	Mistake in not sorting the last map. Then a bit thinking into part 2.                                        |
|   6  	 |              0:22  	 | 	Part 2 to easy.                                                                                              |
|   7  	 |              1:13  	 | 	Part 1 took me longer than expected. Maybe too fragmented programming time?                                  |
|   8  	 | 2:07+7m+1:27+      	 | 	Part 2 gave me headaches.                                                                                    |
|   9  	 |              0:20  	 | 	Surprisingly easy and fast after day 08.                                                                     |
|  10  	 |              3:01  	 | 	Part 1 took me longer. Part 2 (insides) gave me hard time.                                                   |
|  11  	 |              0:42  	 | 	Twas fine                                                                                                    |
|  12  	 |             5h+7m  	 | 	Profiling won't solve algorithm's big complexity. I think I knew that before. Part 1 in almost 5 hours. Uff. |
|  13  	 |    30m+10m = 0:40  	 | 	Finely some of the easier ones (for me).                                                                     |
