# Times to program/solve

Roughly :-) Not counting time to think, as I usually read the problem statement before I have time to solve it.

|   7  	 |                 1:13  	 | 	Part 1 took me longer than expected. Maybe too fragmented programming time?                                                                              |

|  10  	 |                 3:01  	 | 	Part 1 took me longer. Part 2 (insides) gave me hard time.                                                                                               |

|  12  	 |                5h+7m  	 | 	Profiling won't solve algorithm's big complexity. I think I knew that before. Part 1 in almost 5 hours. Uff.                                             |

|  16  	 | 58m+ 13m              	 | 	That cheeky mirror on starting tile in Part 1! Part 2 can be optimized (now 26s). Could cross all beams leaving grid, as they will have the same energy. |
