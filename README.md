Checklist to do before next year:
* buy ideally all Xmas presents
* practice a bit in November if you have extra time, to get back into the competitive programming mindset
* create new year in the repo
* create new year in the timing Google sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13yICIidaWsiBIB9buuST18wLCKJOFSxXxbqbYE8P_10/edit?gid=0#gid=0 (Some tips are in it as well)
* prepare the Python environment (try newer faster python? maybe some requirements)

TODOs:
* have possibility of running from cmd with utils import!
* delete my inputs
* maybe rly have just examples in the code? and just file per day? or not
* requirements and make sure u have numpy?
* rename 2023 days - add suffix with my short problem name
* create Range/Interval class with operations (maybe even list of ranges) - would help in 2025-05, etc. but sorting helps a lot for these kinds of puzzles
